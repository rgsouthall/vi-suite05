@article{Southall2017, abstract = {The VI-Suite is a free and open-source addon for the 3D content creation application Blender, developed primarily as a tool for the contextual and performative analysis of buildings. Its functionality has grown from simple, static lighting analysis to fully parametric lighting, shadowing, and building energy analyses. It adopts a flexible, mesh geometry based approach to the specification of calculation points and this has made it suitable for certain types of 3D geospatial analyses and data visualisation.}, author = {Southall, Ryan and Biljecki, Filip}, day = {14}, doi = {10.1186/s40965-017-0036-1}, issn = {2363-7501}, journal = {Open Geospatial Data, Software and Standards}, month = {Sep}, number = {1}, pages = {23}, title = {{The VI-Suite: a set of environmental analysis tools with geospatial data applications}}, url = {https://doi.org/10.1186/s40965-017-0036-1}, volume = {2}, year = {2017} }
